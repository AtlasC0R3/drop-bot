# The Languages
This directory is for all the built-in languages. You can edit any of these files, and the changes will be loaded on every bot startup.

If you want to translate the bot to another language, well

## Translating
~~I'm sorry.~~ Translating this bot to another language is pretty straightforward.

1) Duplicate `default.json`, and name it to the language you are translating it to (it can be `turkish.json`, `japanese.json`, `russian.json`, etc.).
**NOTE**: the file name must be in lowercase!

2) Edit the strings inside the list to match the translation of the English version.
**Please leave the {\*} things intact, do not modify them!** If you feel you cannot translate a certain string, you can leave it empty, and the bot will automatically fall back to the English version.
   
3) Save the JSON, launch the bot, and it should load your language!

If you'd like to share your translation *(or edit a translation)*, you can open a pull request, and it will probably be merged into the main branch (thanks!).


*dammit now I have fewer excuses to not make the bot have a language that makes it say suggestive things*
